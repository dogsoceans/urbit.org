Thank you for stopping by our studio. Get comfortable. Have a look around. ~fabled-faster might even make you a coffee, if you’d like.

Historically, we’ve kept our process in the dark. We’ve also taken our time. We spent nearly a decade working on the core development of Urbit, after all.

This group—built with tools of our own creation—is an effort to pull back the curtain and offer more frequent insights into your work.

What does the Tlon team do all day? What are we working on? What are we thinking about? Are we getting enough sleep? Stick around and find out.
